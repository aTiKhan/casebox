Casebox
======================================================

Casebox was a solution for collaborative litigation management, designed with human rights organizations in mind. Among other features, it allowed for: 

* document and records management
* task assignment and tracking
* document preview and editing
* powerful search with filtering
* creation of graphs and charts
* forms with conditional logic

In 2020, we announced the sunset of Casebox, meaning that we no longer maintain or develop the softwareâ€™s codebase. You can read more about this decision [here](https://huridocs.org/2020/10/sunset-of-casebox-openevsys-to-expand-uwazi/). 

Self-hosted Casebox instances should continue to work for some time. However, we recommend that you transition to another solution, as Casebox will no longer receive updates and could acquire security vulnerabilities in the future.
